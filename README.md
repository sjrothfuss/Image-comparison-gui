# Image Comparison GUI
SJ Rothfuss

It is difficult to compare images collected with different modalities due to differences of scale. Scale bars help with this but the need to infer from the length of a scale bar means it is not always immediately obvious how two structures compare. 

This imperfect applet built in Python tkinter allows visual comparison of .nd2 format images by reading their scale from their metadata and scaling them appropriately to show both at the same scale.
